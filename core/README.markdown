FaabBB 3 Core
============================================================
You can see, the FaabBB 3 core is written in PHP. The FaabBB 3 core uses 
pre-defined functions, variables and classes that comes along with the PHP function library 
that can be found at <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/funcref.php">http://php.net/manual/en/funcref.php</a>; or
classes from the Core library.

Warning
-----------
This folder contains files which represents the FaabBB **core** of your website.
The **core** class is the one who handles errors and exception. This means it can't handle it's own errors.

**ONLY EDIT THE CORE WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!!**
